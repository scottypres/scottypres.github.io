        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Edit Wind Speed Thresholds:</strong>
            
        <button>Edit Wind Speed Thresholds</button>
            This feature lets you customize the color-coding for various wind speeds on the visualization. By assigning specific RGB
            colors to defined wind speed ranges, you can create a personalized, multi-level view of wind conditions across different
            altitudes over an extended time frame. The primary objective of this webpage is to offer an intuitive and interactive
            method to graphically represent and monitor wind patterns that are critical for flight planning.

        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Wind/Clouds Toggle:</strong>
            <button>Wind/Clouds</button>
            By clicking this button, you can switch the view between displaying the wind speed/direction and the cloud cover
            information. This allows you to assess the flying conditions more comprehensively by considering both wind behavior at
            different altitudes and cloud coverage.
            
        </div>
        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Cloud Cover Representation:</strong>
            Cloud cover is visualized with varying shades of grey in the cells. Darker shades represent heavier cloud cover,
            while lighter shades indicate lighter cloud cover or clear skies.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Temperature Toggle:</strong>
            <button>Temperature</button>
            Use this button to toggle between viewing wind/cloud data and temperature data across different altitudes. This feature
            helps you to visualize the temperature conditions and make informed decisions for your flight.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Enable/Disable Wind Shear:</strong>
            <button>Wind Shear</button>
            Wind shear can present significant hazards to flight. This button allows you to enable an analysis which visually
            indicates where wind shear conditions are detected based on the threshold settings for wind speed and direction change.
            They are 10mph and 90 degrees. This analysis is a work in progress and is only applied to ICON data and altitudes up to
            6000ft.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Daylight/Night Toggle:</strong>
            <button>All Hours</button><button>Daylight Hours</button>
            This functionality filters the displayed data to show only the daylight hours (calculated from sunrise sunset values and column headers circled in orange).
            Piloting during dark hours can be risky, so you may use this filter to focus on the relevant flight times.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Show High Altitude:</strong>
            <button>High Altitude</button>
            You can toggle the visibility of high altitude data by clicking this button. If you're interested in flying at higher
            elevations, this can help you plan ahead and avoid potentially dangerous zones.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Additional Variables Toggle:</strong>
            <button>Additional Variables</button>
            This feature adds or removes additional weather variables such as Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) or
            precipitation probability, which can be crucial for understanding developing weather conditions that might affect your
            flight. Precipitation probability is only available for the ICON model.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction button">
            <strong>Best Hours:</strong>
            <button>Best Hours</button>
            Upon clicking this button, a popup will appear allowing you to input values for maximum wind speed you are comfortable
            flying in. The system will then highlight the hours in which wind speeds are below this threshold at 0-400ft. This does
            not yet consider precipitation probability.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction buton">
            <strong>Wind Arrows:</strong>
            Wind direction is indicated by arrows within the data cells. These arrows rotate to point in the direction the wind is
            going.
        </div>
